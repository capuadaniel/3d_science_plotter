=== How to ===
Hello, this is a WIP, for now you can copy the "base" directory and use the files to obtain non parametric statistical tests.
Cool  things you should try:
- Use a simple binomial test with t_binomial() function
- Or the famous XÂ² = t_quiquadrado()
- You have a prediction but its not a normal curve? t_kolmogorovsmirnov()
- You think that your data is simetrical? Maybe normal? Let's test with t_infsimetria()
- If you need to proof that your data is random test this with t_aleatoriedade()

Other tests are being added for 2 depending variables, and the next step 2 independent variables.

The idea is to write a bigger system with funtionalities that helps us to plot in 2d and 3d more elaborate data withou lose the needed statistical rigor.
Better visualization can acelerate data interpretation and improve a lot of workers progress.
